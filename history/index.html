        <p>Twitter plays a crucial role in politics these days. Gone are the days of door-to-door campaigning and trying
            to reach the last man. Today, power is weilded by those who can tweet. A carefully worded 140 character
            phrase carries the ability to swing states and potentially change the course of an entire nation. The goal
            of our project is to analyse the impact of Twitter on society and understand how ideas are spread across a
            network.</p>

        <p>In order to investigate this question, our proposal is to analyse the tweets posted by Trump on Twitter over
            time to discover what was the main focus of his campaign, how it changed and how the society reacts to his
            discourses and proposals.</p>

        <p>The <a href="http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/">Trump Twitter Archive</a> is a project that has been
            collecting Trump's tweets since 2009 but the main focus of this project will be the period of his campaign.

            Sentimental Analysis
        </h3>
        
        <p>Humans are "generally" sentimental and emotional beings. Analysing the sentiment of someone's tweets' could
        	tell us a great deal about the general thought process of the person. Here, we will present an in-depth analysis
        	of the sentiments expressed by Trump on Twitter.
        </p>
        	
        <p>
        	Let us look at the distribution of the number of tweets classified based on the sentiments expressed in them. The
        	raw sentiment scores lie between -1 and 1, with -1 denoting the most negative sentiment and vice versa.
        </p>
        
        <img src="figures/sentiment_counts.png" alt="Tweet Count by Sentiment">
        
        <p>Although majority (~43%) of tweets have been classified as neutral, a significant (~20%) are negative. Let us look
        at some of these tweets :</p>
        
        <div align='center'>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The FAKE &amp; FRAUDULENT NEWS MEDIA is working hard to convince Republicans and others I should not use social media - but remember, I won....</p>&mdash; Donald J.

		<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Watched low rated <a href="https://twitter.com/Morning_Joe?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Morning_Joe</a> for first time in long time.

		<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
		</div>
		
		While some of the positive ones are as follows :
		
		<div align='center'>
		<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just finished a very good meeting with the President of South Korea. Many subjects discussed including North Korea and new trade deal!</p>&mdash; Donald J.

		<p>
		It would also be interesting to see the temporal pattern in the distribution of the number of tweets based on the sentiment
		expressed in them.
		</p>
		
		<img src="figures/sentiment_counts_quarter.png" alt="Tweet Count by Sentiment per quarter">

		<p>
		While the number of tweets by Trump has decreased in general, the proportion of negative tweets has gone up, and more so,
		after he was elected as the president. Let us now look at how these tweets were perceived by the public. We will use the
		total number of retweets and likes (favorited) as a metric.
		</p>

		<img src="figures/sentiment_retweet_favorited.png" alt="Tweet Count by Sentiment per quarter">
		
		<img src="figures/sentiment_retweets_quarter.png" alt="Tweet Count by Sentiment per quarter">
		
		<p>
		It is interesting to note that while the total number of negative tweets is only about ~20% in total, the number of retweets
		and favorited/likes are almost similar across the three categories of sentiments. This could be indicative of the fact that people are
		more gullible and supportive towards negative tweets by Trump.

        <h3>
            Source Analysis
        </h3>
        
        <p>
        	It is a well known fact that Trump's official Twitter handle @realDonaldTrump is also accessible by his
        	media and other supporting teams. Trump has been personally known to use an "Android" phone while his team either uses
        	the Twitter Web Client or an iPhone. Since the Twitter API allows us to differentiate between the "source" of a tweet, 
        	it would be interesting to see if there are any differentiating patterns based on the source.
        </p>
        
        <p>Trump and his team have clearly used numerous devices/sources for connecting with the world on Twitter. Here is a
        comprehensive list ordered according to total number of tweets originating from them : 
        'Twitter for Android', 'Twitter Web Client', 'Twitter for iPhone',
       'TweetDeck', 'TwitLonger Beta', 'Instagram', 'Facebook',
       'Twitter for BlackBerry', 'Twitter Ads', 'Mobile Web (M5)',
       'Twitlonger', 'Twitter for iPad', 'Media Studio', 'Twitter QandA',
       'Vine - Make a Scene', 'Periscope', 'Neatly For BlackBerry 10',
       'Twitter Mirror for iPad', 'Twitter for Websites'.
       </p>
        	
        <p>Let us take a look at the active-ness of these different sources which can be quantified by the number of tweets in
        	a given time period.</p> 
        	
        <img src="figures/device_over_time.png" alt="Devices By Month">
        
        <p>"Twitter for Android" has been relatively the most active source from Q2 2013 to Q2 2016. Note that, Trump's
        presidential campaign officially started in Q2 2015 and he won the election in Q4 2016.</p>
        
        <p>Since we are aware that Trump personally uses Android for tweeting, it would be interesting to analyse the statistics
        of sentiments in tweets based on the source. 
		</p>
		
		<img src="figures/sentiment_android_quarter.png" alt="Devices By Month">
		
		<img src="figures/sentiment_nonandroid_quarter.png" alt="Devices By Month">
		
		<p>
		It is not surprising that compared sources other than itself, tweets from Android has greater proportion of negative
		tweets.
